Now we are ready to help all displaced people who were forced to flee from war or natural disasters, regardless of which country they fled from and in which country they ended up.",
            "We work with volunteer teachers who are ready to teach the language for free for several hours a week. Some of our teachers are professionals in their field, and some are native speakers who want to learn how to teach.",            
            "Our team of methodologists and teachers supports beginners through workshops, teachers’ guides and additional materials for classes.",
            "All of our classes are free of charge, online, held individually or in groups of up to 5 people. We form groups depending on the level of knowledge and goals of students, and we make sure that our classes help not only learn the basic language but also quickly navigate in a crisis situation, for example, learn the special vocabulary to prepare for employment or university admission."

Despite the fact that we are far from each other, we are united by a desire to help refugees and a common position – we are against war.",
